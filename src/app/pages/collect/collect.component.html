        My Trip has it all: a journey to the farthest reaches of the dark web,
        DMT hallucinations and existential crises. Explore the
        techno-underground with the artist’s weird and wacky crew. Melgaard
        raises the contradictory view that if we are to continue to exist,
        humans will have to cease to procreate, as a result of the carbon impact
        of producing new human life.

        The VR experience which inspires this film was shown at Sundance and is
        accompanied by a soundtrack created specifically for My Trip by
        Melgaard’s long-time collaborator Romina Cohn. Watch the full trailer
        above.
